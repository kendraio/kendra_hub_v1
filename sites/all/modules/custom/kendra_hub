Kendra Hub is a UK TSB funded project to develop an application to manage
collaboration, metadata and rights, and distribution.

It will not be a service like SoundCloud or Facebook, but an
open-source application, building on Federated Social Web
technologies that enables artists, labels, and service providers
to collaborate via open standards and protocols.
